Overview of the School District Analysis
Results

The school board has requested us to analyze the entire district involving funding and student grades and provide any new insights and performance of the schools. During the analysis we were informed of suspect results from a particular group of students at one of the schools. Our process was to perform the analysis twice - once with the full data set then again isolating the suspect data and excluding it.
•	How is the district summary affected?
Once taking a look at district summaries from both pycityschools_challenge district summary was not affected.
•	How is the school summary affected?
The passing for Thomas High School was 90.94% in pycityschools, with the 9th graders removed the total passing shrinks by 0.3%
•	How does replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores affect Thomas High School's performance relative to the other schools?
This does not affect either the math scores or the reading scores. Upon investigation we believe they are not including most 9th graders scores because they might bring the school even further down in test scores.

•	How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

.	Math and reading scores by grade

Replacing the ninth-grade scores affected: the scores is that under 9th graders who attended Thomas High School it shows NaN

.	Scores by school spending

The numbers stay nearly identical since the 9th graders are nullified from the statistics.

.	Scores by school size

Overall passing percentage does not change.

.	Scores by school type

Scores by school type are not altered at all.

Summary
After we have replaced the scores of the 9th grade students we learn that not much has changed. We nullified the values that we felt would alter spending, district, size and overall passing percentage of the students.
